# DuckDB HTS File Reader Extension for R

The Rduckhts package provides an interface to the DuckDB HTS (High
Throughput Sequencing) file reader extension from within R. It enables
reading common bioinformatics file formats such as VCF/BCF,
SAM/BAM/CRAM, FASTA, FASTQ, GFF, GTF, and tabix-indexed files directly
from R using SQL queries via DuckDB.
