\title{DuckDB HTS File Reader Extension for R}
\description{
The Rduckhts package provides an interface to the DuckDB HTS (High Throughput Sequencing)
file reader extension from within R. It enables reading common bioinformatics file formats
such as VCF/BCF, SAM/BAM/CRAM, FASTA, FASTQ, GFF, GTF, and tabix-indexed files
directly from R using SQL queries via DuckDB.
